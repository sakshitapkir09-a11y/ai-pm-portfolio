# AI Product Manager Portfolio

I learn by shipping: from piloting e-mobility to architecting LLM/robotics, I blend user research, fast iterations, and measurable impact. This repo showcases AI PM skills, MSEM rigor, and real-world wins—quantified outcomes in automotive, energy, and automation sectors.

## About Me

MS Engineering Management graduate (SJSU) and SAE national champion transitioning to AI Product Management roles. I combine deep technical expertise (embedded systems, industrial automation, Six Sigma) with product thinking—leading field pilots, iterating on user feedback, and shipping metric-driven solutions.

**Core Strengths:**
- Human-centered AI design for automotive, energy, and robotics
- End-to-end product ownership: research → roadmap → pilot → scale
- Cross-functional leadership with engineering, design, and business teams
- Data-driven decision-making: Python, Minitab, ML model evaluation
- Strategic frameworks: JTBD, Stage-Gate, Lean Startup, RICE prioritization
