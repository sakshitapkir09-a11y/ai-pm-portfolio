# Linkedin Learning: Innovating with AI Design for Autonomous Vehicles

**Institution:** Linkedin Learning  
**Course:** AI Literacy - Innovating with AI Design Using Autonomous Vehicles  
**Instructor:** Sudha Jamthe  
**Date:** 2025

## Overview

Completed AI literacy coursework focused on human-centric AI experience design for autonomous vehicles. Explored the AIX (AI Experience) Framework, ethical AI deployment, trust-building interfaces, and product design strategies that balance technical capability with user safety, dignity, and inclusion.

## My Focus

- Applied **AIX Framework** (3-layer model: AI Character, AI Type, User Data) to design transparent, trustworthy AV interfaces
- Analyzed **human-centric design principles** for in-car AI experiences (voice, AR, computer vision, sensor integration)
- Studied **MLUX (Machine Learning UX)** for climate control, personalized recommendations, and ADAS features
- Evaluated **ethical considerations**: bias mitigation, data consent, false prediction handling, pedestrian dignity
- Designed **user-facing AI interactions**: drowsy detection, lane assist, voice AI personality, software update timing

## Core Concepts & Frameworks

- **AIX Framework (3 Layers):**
  - AI Character: Personality, tone, gender, name customization
  - AI Type: Traditional ML vs Generative AI, Computer Vision, NLP
  - User Data: Consent, privacy, behavioral pattern collection

- **Human-Centric Design for AVs:**
  - Transparency: Voice explanations of car actions
  - Empathy: In-car cameras to detect passenger comfort
  - Safety: AR overlays for situational awareness

- **ADAS Feature Design:**
  - Lane Assist, Drowsy Detection, Collision Warnings
  - User control and opt-out for privacy-invasive features

- **Ethics & Trust:**
  - Pedestrian recognition as people, not objects
  - Handling AI hallucinations and false negatives
  - Dignity-preserving voice AI design

## Key Learnings for AI Product Management

- **Cross-functional collaboration:** UX/UI designers, AI engineers, behavioral scientists, ethicists, safety experts must co-design AV experiences
- **Trust calibration:** Interfaces must communicate AI limitations transparently to avoid over-reliance or under-trust
- **Bias awareness:** Computer vision and voice AI can encode bias—design must actively counter this
- **User agency:** Allow users to customize, disable, or override AI features to preserve autonomy
- **Regulatory alignment:** Data consent and privacy must be baked into product design, not retrofitted

## Why This Matters for Product Management

- **Automotive AI PM roles** require deep understanding of ADAS, sensor fusion, HMI design, and regulatory compliance
- **Human factors expertise** is critical when AI decisions impact safety-critical systems
- **Ethical AI deployment** differentiates trusted products from those that erode user confidence
- Demonstrates readiness to **bridge technical AI capabilities with user-centric product strategy**
