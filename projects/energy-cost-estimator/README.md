# AI-Powered Energy Project Cost Estimator

A machine learning tool for instant cost estimation in energy projects, developed in ISE 200 at SJSU.  
- Used Random Forest (MAE $367k, R² 0.99)
- Automated cost estimation, delivered real-time insights
- Feature importance and SHAP analysis for transparency

See `ISE 200 Project Report.pdf` for full methodology, results, and key achievements.
