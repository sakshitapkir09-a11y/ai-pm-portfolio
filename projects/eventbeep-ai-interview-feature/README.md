# EventBeep AI Mock Interview Feature: Product Management Case Study

**Role:** Product Manager (Case Study)  
**Date:** December 2023  
**Focus:** AI-powered career platform for students—product review, feature specification, and go-to-market strategy

## Overview

Conducted end-to-end product management work for EventBeep, a student-focused job hunting app. Delivered comprehensive product review identifying strategic growth opportunities, followed by detailed feature specification for an AI Mock Interview tool—including PRD, wireframes, user journey, success metrics, risk mitigation, and engineering handoff documentation.

## My Role & Deliverables

- **Product Review & Strategic Recommendations:** Analyzed EventBeep's core value proposition, identified untapped markets (non-CS engineering students), and proposed expansion strategy to diversify user base and increase market penetration
- **Feature Specification (PRD):** Designed AI Mock Interview feature from concept to engineering-ready spec, including technical architecture, NLP requirements, speech recognition integration, and feedback generation logic
- **User Experience Design:** Created wireframes, defined user journey, and specified pre/post-interview flows optimized for student engagement and skill development
- **Success Metrics & KPIs:** Defined measurable outcomes (user engagement, interview pass rates, NPS) and performance requirements (response time, throughput, load testing)
- **Risk Assessment & Mitigation:** Identified 7 key risks (AI bias, speech recognition accuracy, data privacy) with detailed mitigation strategies for each

## Key Insights from Product Review

### What's Working
- **Laser focus on students:** Curated internship/entry-level listings with no noise from irrelevant postings
- **Personalized recommendations:** AI-driven matching based on profiles, interests, and career goals
- **Direct messaging with companies:** Eliminates traditional application black holes, enables authentic dialogue
- **Community features:** Student forums, Q&A, virtual career fairs build network and belonging

### Strategic Growth Opportunities
- **Expand beyond CS/IT:** 80%+ of engineering students (mechanical, civil, electrical, chemical) underserved—massive untapped market with higher unemployment rates than CS/IT
- **Quality control:** Stricter job posting validation to maintain trust and reduce student frustration
- **Skill matching refinement:** Granular user profiles for more precise recommendations
- **Reward system transparency:** Clearer coin-earning pathways aligned with user goals

## AI Mock Interview Feature Specification

### Purpose
Provide students with personalized, AI-powered interview practice to improve communication, confidence, and technical knowledge—bridging the gap between education and real-world job readiness.

### Core Functionality
- **AI-driven interview simulation:** Multiple scenarios (technical, behavioral, product design) with customizable difficulty and focus areas
- **Real-time feedback:** NLP analysis of clarity, confidence, technical accuracy, and sentiment during responses
- **Speech-to-text integration:** Cloud-based or offline speech recognition with accent/dialect handling
- **Post-interview reports:** Comprehensive feedback with strengths, weaknesses, improvement suggestions, and progress tracking over time
- **Personalized practice:** Tracks user progress, recommends focus areas, integrates with calendar for scheduling real interviews

### Technical Architecture
- **AI Model Options:**
  - Pre-trained conversational AI (DialoGPT, BlenderBot) fine-tuned for interviews
  - Custom rule-based + ML hybrid model for domain-specific assessments
- **Speech Recognition:** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or Amazon Transcribe with privacy-first offline options
- **NLP Pipeline:** Analyzes communication clarity, confidence tone, technical keywords, sentiment (nervousness/hesitation)
- **Feedback Engine:** Real-time generation of actionable suggestions with audio/visual cues

### User Journey
1. Student selects interview scenario (technical, behavioral, etc.)
2. Customizes settings (length, difficulty, focus areas)
3. AI conducts simulated interview with verbal Q&A
4. Student receives real-time visual cues (confidence indicators, progress bars)
5. Comprehensive post-interview report with detailed feedback
6. Student reviews, practices again, or explores new scenarios

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **User Engagement** | 500+ students/week | Weekly active users of AI Mock Interview |
| **Feedback Utilization** | 70%+ implementation rate | % of students who apply feedback in subsequent interviews |
| **Interview Success Rate** | 15%+ improvement | Comparison of pass rates vs. non-users |
| **User Satisfaction** | NPS ≥ 40 | Surveys measuring feature quality and effectiveness |
| **Response Time** | ≤2 seconds | Real-time feedback latency during simulations |

### Risk Mitigation Plan
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **AI Bias** | Disadvantages certain demographics | Diverse training data, bias detection techniques, human-in-loop validation |
| **Speech Recognition Errors** | Inaccurate feedback, user frustration | High-accuracy engine, voice clarity indicators, manual review option |
| **NLP Misinterpretation** | Misleading feedback | Context-aware NLP, human reviewers, clear explanations with examples |
| **Infrastructure Scalability** | Performance issues at scale | Cloud-based architecture, load testing, auto-scaling tools |
| **Data Privacy** | Security breaches, consent violations | Encryption, access controls, explicit user consent, transparent data policies |
| **Low User Adoption** | Feature underutilization | User research, A/B testing, gamification, university partnerships |
| **Ethical Concerns** | Unrealistic expectations, anxiety | Frame as practice tool, provide wellness resources, ethical oversight |

## Why This Matters for Product Management

- **End-to-end PM ownership:** Demonstrates full product lifecycle—from strategic insight to engineering handoff
- **Technical depth:** Shows ability to specify AI/ML requirements, NLP pipelines, and performance constraints for engineering teams
- **User-centric design:** Balances technical capability with student needs (confidence, skill-building, career readiness)
- **Data-driven decision-making:** Defines clear success metrics, testing protocols, and validation frameworks
- **Risk-aware execution:** Proactively identifies failure modes and builds mitigation into product design
- **Cross-functional communication:** Bridges product vision, user experience, and technical implementation—critical for AI PM roles
