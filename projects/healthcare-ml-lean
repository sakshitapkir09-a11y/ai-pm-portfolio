# Lean Manufacturing & Machine Learning for Heart Failure Care (ISE 251)

## Overview

Applied **Lean Six Sigma** and **machine learning** to optimize heart failure patient care—improving clinical outcomes and operational efficiency. Led end-to-end product lifecycle: problem definition, user research (clinicians/patients), feature prioritization, ML model development, and impact validation.

## My Role

- Conducted workflow analysis and identified waste using Lean principles (DMAIC, 5S, Kaizen)
- Built and validated ML models for mortality prediction using clinical datasets
- Prioritized high-impact clinical features for explainable, trustworthy AI deployment
- Designed data-to-deployment pipeline integrating engineering, human factors, and stakeholder needs
- Quantified business value: improved care quality, reduced costs, enhanced risk stratification

## Methods & Frameworks

- Lean Six Sigma (DMAIC, waste reduction, process mapping)
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Multi-Layer Perceptron, SVM
- Tools: Python, Minitab, statistical analysis
- Evaluation: ROC/AUC, accuracy, F1-score, feature importance analysis

## Key Outcomes

- Identified top clinical predictors: ejection fraction, serum creatinine, age
- Achieved 93% accuracy with SVM (F1-score 0.95); logistic regression AUC 0.90
- Redesigned workflows to eliminate non-value-adding steps, improving throughput
- Delivered explainable AI solution with transparent feature importance for clinical trust
- Demonstrated measurable impact on care efficiency and patient risk management
