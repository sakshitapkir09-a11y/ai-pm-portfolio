**Course:** ISE 245 - Advanced Supply Chain Engineering | San Jose State University  
**Team:** Sarthak Sawale, Shubham Kothawade, Aditya Patil, Sakshi Tapkir  
**Date:** December 2024

## Overview

Led competitive and supply chain strategy analysis of Temu, a disruptive e-commerce platform achieving rapid global growth through ultra-low pricing, direct-from-manufacturer sourcing, and regulatory arbitrage. Evaluated strategic fit between business model and supply chain operations, identified scalability risks, and delivered actionable recommendations for long-term market positioning.

## My Role

- Co-led strategic analysis of Temu's competitive positioning vs. Amazon, Alibaba, Shein
- Mapped end-to-end supply chain: direct sourcing, 3PL logistics, reverse-manufacturing model
- Evaluated regulatory risks (de minimis rule changes) and impact on cost structure and profitability
- Synthesized improvement opportunities: quality assurance, sustainability, delivery speed, customer service
- Delivered comprehensive report with strategic recommendations for operational resilience and market differentiation

## Methods & Frameworks

- **Competitive Strategy Analysis:** Porter's Five Forces, cost leadership positioning, pricing dynamics
- **Supply Chain Mapping:** Direct sourcing models, flexible supplier networks, 3PL optimization
- **Strategic Fit Evaluation:** Alignment of competitive goals (low price, responsiveness) with supply chain capabilities
- **Risk Assessment:** Regulatory scrutiny, logistics limitations, IP issues, geopolitical disruptions
- **Benchmarking:** Comparative analysis vs. Amazon FBA, Alibaba, Shein logistics and fulfillment models

## Key Findings

| Dimension | Insight | PM Takeaway |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Competitive Strategy** | Ultra-low pricing via direct sourcing + gamified shopping (group buying, flash sales) drives customer acquisition | Cost leadership requires end-to-end supply chain control; pricing alone insufficient without retention mechanisms |
| **Supply Chain Model** | Direct-from-manufacturer sourcing eliminates intermediaries; reverse-manufacturing enables rapid product iteration based on user feedback | Tight supplier-customer feedback loops = faster product-market fit; critical for agile product development |
| **Strategic Fit** | Business model and supply chain aligned for cost efficiency, but vulnerable to regulatory changes (de minimis rule) | External dependencies (trade policy, geopolitics) require scenario planning and diversification strategies |
| **Scalability Risks** | Long delivery times, variable product quality, heavy reliance on China sourcing | Must balance cost with speed, quality, and resilience—key tradeoffs for global PM roles |

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Quality Assurance:** Implement rigorous supplier audits and quality standards to reduce product inconsistency and build customer trust
2. **Sustainability Integration:** Adopt eco-friendly packaging, ethical sourcing, and carbon-reduction initiatives to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers
3. **Delivery Speed Optimization:** Establish regional fulfillment centers and partner with local last-mile providers to compete with Amazon Prime
4. **Customer Service Enhancement:** Invest in responsive support, simplified returns/exchanges, and proactive communication to improve NPS
5. **Technological Integration:** Deploy AI-driven demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and personalized marketing to increase operational efficiency
6. **Regulatory Preparedness:** Diversify supplier base, model cost impact of tariff changes, and engage proactively with policymakers

## Competitive Landscape Analysis

- **Amazon:** Enhanced logistics (FBA), faster fulfillment → Temu must invest in speed and regional warehousing
- **Alibaba/Shein:** Similar direct-sourcing models → differentiation requires superior UX, trust, or niche focus
- **Emerging Players:** Niche competitors with specialized value props → Temu needs continuous innovation in engagement and personalization

## Risk & Challenge Mitigation

| Challenge | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Regulatory Changes** | De minimis rule revisions could increase costs, erode pricing advantage | Diversify sourcing regions, model cost scenarios, lobby strategically |
| **Product Quality Variability** | Erodes trust, increases returns, damages brand | Strengthen supplier partnerships, implement quality gates, improve inspection processes |
| **Long Delivery Times** | Customer dissatisfaction vs. Amazon/local retailers | Build regional hubs, optimize cross-border logistics, invest in last-mile partnerships |
| **Supply Chain Disruptions** | Geopolitical risks, natural disasters, pandemics | Expand supplier network, build contingency plans, increase inventory buffers in key markets |

## Why This Matters for Product Management

- **Cost-leadership strategy:** Shows deep understanding of how supply chain decisions directly impact pricing, margin, and competitive positioning—critical for PM roles in e-commerce, logistics, or marketplace platforms
- **Strategic fit thinking:** Demonstrates ability to evaluate alignment between business goals and operational capabilities—core PM skill for roadmap prioritization and trade-off decisions
- **Cross-functional perspective:** Integrates competitive strategy, operations, regulatory risk, and customer experience—mirrors real-world PM responsibility to balance stakeholder needs
- **Scenario planning:** Analyzes future challenges (regulatory shifts, competition) and proposes proactive strategies—essential for long-term product vision and risk management
